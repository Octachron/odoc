deficiencies of ocamldoc. In particular, it aims to:
</p><ul><li>Accurately handle all of the OCaml language, providing accurate links and
references for code bases that make heavy use of OCaml's advanced module
features.</li><li>Support links and references between different libraries and packages.</li></ul><h2 id="install" class="anchored"><a href="#install" class="anchor"></a>Getting odoc</h2><p>Using opam is of course the easiest way:</p><pre>opam install odoc</pre><p>But otherwise you can build it from sources:</p><pre>$ mkdir odoc &amp;&amp; cd odoc &amp;&amp; touch jbuild-workspace.here
$ git clone http://github.com/ocaml-doc/odoc.git
$ git clone http://github.com/ocaml-doc/doc-ock.git
$ git clone http://github.com/ocaml-doc/doc-ock-html.git
$ git clone http://github.com/ocaml-doc/doc-ock-xml.git
$ git clone http://github.com/ocaml-doc/octavius.git
$ jbuilder build @install
$ jbuilder install</pre><p>Assuming you have OCaml â‰¥ 4.03 available and the following set of dependencies
installed:
<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/bos">bos</a>,
<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner">cmdliner</a>,
<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/fpath">fpath</a>,
<a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/">menhir</a>,
<a href="http://ocsigen.org/tyxml/">tyxml</a> and
<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/xmlm">xmlm</a> as well as
<a href="http://github.com/janestreet/jbuilder">jbuilder</a> for building. All of which
are available from opam.</p><h2 id="usage" class="anchored"><a href="#usage" class="anchor"></a>Using odoc</h2><p><a href="http://jbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-doc.html">Jbuilder</a> and
<a href="http://erratique.ch/software/odig">Odig</a> already know how to invoke odoc for
you on your libraries.
They are definitely the easiest, and recommended, way to use odoc for
individuals.</p><p>If you want to add support for odoc to your preferred build system, or simply
don't want to use Jbuilder or Odig, you can always invoke odoc directly.
Instructions regarding how it should be run are available
<a href="manual_usage.html">here</a>.</p><h4 id="ocamldoc" class="anchored"><a href="#ocamldoc" class="anchor"></a>Divergences from ocamldoc</h4><p>Your docstrings written to work with ocamldoc should be transparently supported
by odoc. However some additions have been made to the syntax which are described
<a href="../octavius/syntax.html">here</a>.</p><h2 id="contributing" class="anchored"><a href="#contributing" class="anchor"></a>Contributing</h2><h4 id="issues" class="anchored"><a href="#issues" class="anchor"></a>Reporting issues</h4><p>The easiest way to contribute is to report any issue you encounter
<a href="http://github.com/ocaml-doc/odoc/issues">here</a>.</p><h4 id="internals" class="anchored"><a href="#internals" class="anchor"></a>Internal organization of odoc</h4><p>If you wish to contribute to odoc, for example by fixing some bugs, you should
know that odoc is split into the following set of packages:</p><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/ocaml-doc/octavius">octavius</a> is a parser for a simple
documentation language.
While <code class="code">doc-ock</code> uses it to parse the documentation comments, it is independent
of the other parts of odoc and can also be used by other tools (eg. a
<a href="https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_js_style/blob/master/src/ppx_js_style.ml#L208">linter</a>
for ocaml sources which would also check the syntax of docstrings).</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/ocaml-doc/doc-ock">doc-ock</a> deals with the problem of
cross-referencing within OCaml's semantics. It has no idea of how things are
divided into packages or laid out on the file system -- its whole job lives
within the OCaml language's semantics.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/ocaml-doc/doc-ock-html">doc-ock-html</a> is fundamentally
just a function from <a href="../doc-ock/DocOckTypes/index.html">doc-ock's representation</a> to HTML. This
should take care of everything to do with how the documentation looks in the
browser.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/ocaml-doc/doc-ock-xml">doc-ock-xml</a> is mostly legacy at
this point. Originally, odoc files weren't marshalled AST but an XML
representation of the AST. That later changed for performance (and disk space
usage) reasons, but we've kept the library around (and expose it through a
<code class="code">to-xml</code> command) mainly for debugging purposes. We plan to get rid of it
soon.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/ocaml-doc/odoc">odoc</a> deals with the relationship between
the file system, packages, and the OCaml language semantics (e.g. this module is
from this file and lives in this package).
Since it deals with the file system it is also in charge of handling
<code class="code">doc-ock</code>s multiple stages (e.g. managing where the <code class="code">.odoc</code> intermediate files
live and making sure things are run in the right dependency order).</li></ul><h4 id="contribution_new_backend" class="anchored"><a href="#contribution_new_backend" class="anchor"></a>Adding a backend to odoc</h4><p>Adding a new backend (latex, anyone?) to odoc then consists of writing a library
similar to <code class="code">doc-ock-html</code> and exposing a new command in odoc working similarly
to <a href="Odoc/Html/index.html"><code class="code">odoc html</code></a>.</p></body></html>
